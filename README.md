You've discovered **s18.in**: the internet's most exclusive club that looks like a secret code.

- This is **not a website**.
- This is **not a blog**.
- This is **not a social network**.

## Why s18.in?

- Short domains save precious typing time.
- Because we couldn't afford .com.
- This is just a domain that sounds like you're in a spy movie.

## About

Congratulations! You're already cooler than most people who just type s18.in into their browser.

There's nothing else to see here. Move along!
